# HydroServer Quality Control App

This web app facilitates QC/QA for time series observations stored in a HydroServer database instance. It features a multi-axis plot for visually overlaying datastreams and includes QC tools such as linear drift correction and interpolation.

## What it does

The app is the operator's view of HydroServer's QC pipeline:

1. **Browse** — pick a workspace, filter datastreams by site / observed property / processing level, and plot up to five at once on a synchronized multi-axis chart.
2. **QC one stream at a time** — the first plotted stream is the QC target. The other plotted traces are read-only context.
3. **Filter / edit / add** — every operation (Value Threshold, Find Gaps, Persistence, Interpolate, Drift Correction, Fill Gaps, Add Points, etc.) commits a `HistoryItem` to a replayable edit history backed by [`@uwrl/qc-utils`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@uwrl/qc-utils).
4. **Save / load a QC script** — export the history as a JSON document, replay it on the same datastream a week later, or templatize across stations.
5. **Submit** — push the quality-controlled observations back to HydroServer in `replace` mode.

The heavy lifting (worker-parallelized typed-array kernels, calibration, history replay, save / load wire format) lives in `@uwrl/qc-utils`. This repo is the Vue / Vuetify / Pinia / Plotly UI plus the orchestration around it.

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
# Create .env.local with at least VITE_APP_API_URL (see Configuration below).
npm run dev                  # http://127.0.0.1:1203
```

**Use `127.0.0.1`, not `localhost`.** The HydroServer backend's CORS allowlist pins the IP literal, and the host name variant fails every API request silently. Vite's dev server is configured for `127.0.0.1:1203` to match.

### Configuration

`.env.local` (or `.env`) drives the runtime config. The keys the app reads:

| Var                              | Required | Purpose                                                                 |
|----------------------------------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `VITE_APP_API_URL`               | yes      | Base URL of the HydroServer instance (e.g. `https://playground.hydroserver.org`). |
| `VITE_APP_VERSION`               | no       | Build-time version string surfaced in the about menu.                   |
| `VITE_APP_GOOGLE_OAUTH_ENABLED`  | no       | Show the Google sign-in button.                                         |
| `VITE_APP_DISABLE_ACCOUNT_CREATION` | no    | Hide the sign-up button (useful for invite-only deployments).           |
| `VITE_APP_DISABLE_COOP`          | no       | Drop the `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy` + `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy` headers. Use only when the backend you're hitting doesn't serve `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy` (older HydroServer deployments). The `qc-utils` worker layer falls back to inline kernels when SAB isn't available, so the app still works — just slower on large edits. |
| `VITE_APP_E2E_HOOKS`             | no       | Set to `1` to expose `window.__vbwTestHooks` for Playwright. CI sets this automatically. |

Cross-origin isolation is on by default (`vite.config.ts` sends `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin` + `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp`) so `SharedArrayBuffer` is available to the qc-utils worker pool.

│  ├─ selected.ts               handleSelected — translates Plotly selection into a SELECTION dispatch.
│  ├─ staging.ts                Ghost-fill markers + drag-resizable stage shape.
│  └─ plotly.ts                 Trace builders + low-level setSelectedPoints / clearSelection.
└─ router/                      vue-router 5 setup with workspace + auth guards.
```

The data flow for an edit is always: panel collects args → `useFilterDispatch` / `useQcScript` calls `selectedSeries.data.dispatch(...)` (qc-utils) → qc-utils mutates typed arrays + appends a `HistoryItem` → `redraw()` pushes the new x / y into Plotly. The UI never touches the typed arrays directly.

## Working with `@uwrl/qc-utils` locally

When you're tweaking QC algorithms or worker kernels, link the sibling `qc-utils` checkout instead of bumping the npm version:

```bash
# qc-utils (terminal 1)
npm link
npm run dev          # vite watch — rebuilds dist/ on every save

# hydroserver-qc-app (terminal 2)
npm run link-qc-utils
npm run dev
```

Refresh the browser to pick up `qc-utils` changes — HMR doesn't propagate through linked packages. If the app surfaces stale type errors, run `npm run build` once in `qc-utils` to refresh `.d.ts`.

To unlink: `npm unlink @uwrl/qc-utils && npm install`.

## Testing

### Unit tests (Vitest)

```bash
npm test                      # watch mode
npm run coverage              # one shot + v8 coverage
```

Specs live next to source under `src/**/__tests__/`. Plotly is mocked at the module boundary; qc-utils workers use the inline mocks in `qc-utils/src/utils/plotting/__tests__/workerMocks.ts`.

### End-to-end tests (Playwright)

End-to-end specs cover the QC golden path: load a datastream, apply a filter, apply an edit, submit. Browser matrix: **chromium** and **firefox**. WebKit is intentionally excluded — `SharedArrayBuffer` + COOP / COEP behaviour differs in Safari and needs separate validation.

One-time setup:

```bash
npx playwright install chromium firefox
```

Run modes:

```bash
npm run test:e2e              # headed — opens a visible browser
npm run test:e2e:ci           # headless — CI mode, also fast for local
npm run test:e2e:live         # against playground.hydroserver.org (requires .env.local)
```

The Playwright `webServer` config auto-starts the Vite dev server at `http://127.0.0.1:1203` and reuses an existing one outside CI. The dev server is what serves the COOP / COEP headers `SharedArrayBuffer` needs — running e2e against a static `file://` build won't work.

The mocked specs (everything except `qc-golden-path.spec.ts`) intercept HydroServer routes via `page.route()` and serve fixture JSON, so most runs need no backend. The live `qc-golden-path` spec talks to `playground.hydroserver.org` and reads credentials from `.env.local`.

E2E specs live in `e2e/` (separate from the Vitest unit specs under `src/**/__tests__/`).
