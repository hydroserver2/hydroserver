/**
 * `handleSelected` is called from `handleClick` (with a `PlotMouseEvent`),
 * from `handleRelayout` (with a `PlotRelayoutEvent`-shaped object), and
 * occasionally with `null`/`undefined` to mean "re-sync the QC selection
 * without dispatching a filter".
 *
 * The SELECTION-dispatch branch is the source-of-truth for "user just
 * selected something on the plot". To distinguish a real user gesture
 * from the relayout echo of our own programmatic Plotly writes
 * (`setPlotSelection`, `clearSelected`), the writers arm
 * `suppressedEchoSelection` with the indices their write will land
 * on. When the next `plotly_relayout`-induced `handleSelected` call
 * fires (`fromRelayout: true`) we compare the trace's actual
 * `selectedpoints` against that expected payload — equal means the
 * echo (skip dispatch); different means a user gesture (box / lasso
 * select) raced through the same debounce window, so dispatch
 * normally. The click-induced path (`fromRelayout` falsy, default)
 * ignores the sentinel entirely — user clicks always dispatch.

  //     `setPlotSelection` / `clearSelected`. We always clear it (one-
  //     shot), but only suppress when the current selection MATCHES
  //     what the echo should carry. A mismatch means a real user
  //     gesture overlapped the programmatic write's debounce window,
