## About

This small desktop app is used to run scheduled ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) jobs to transfer data into HydroServer from local time series data files (such as CSV datalogger output files). The app contains a user interface for authenticating with HydroServer as well as a log file for viewing job runs.
