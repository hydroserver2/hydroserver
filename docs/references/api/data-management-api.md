## About

This API contains the extended endpoints HydroServer provides outside of the SensorThings spec, transforming the overarching HydroServer API layer into a comprehensive data management tool. Specifically, the Data Management API introduces orchestration systems, data archival, and extended metadata such as units, processing levels, result qualifiers, photos, and tagging. It also contains database fields for storing controlled vocabularies. This API offers endpoints to access both your data and data shared by others in your system.
