# Creating Your First Site

## Create an account on our playground instance

Go to [`https://playground.hydroserver.org`](https://playground.hydroserver.org).

Click the 'Sign up' button on the top right of the page to create an account for Playground. Note, user information is public so everyone else on playground will see your account information, so choose information you're OK with sharing.

## Create a workspace

After verifying your email address, the website should navigate you to the 'Sites' page with a blank map on the top and a 'workspaces' table on the bottom. If it didn't, you can navigate to it via the 'Your sites' button on the main navigation menu.

Before creating your first site, you'll need to create a workspace for that site to go in (most of HydroServer's access control happens at the workspace level, so resources like sites and datastreams belong to a workspace).

Click 'Add workspace' and give it a name. Make it unique since everyone's workspace will be visible. If you're shy and don't want other users to see your beautiful workspace, you can check the 'make this workspace private' button. This will hide the workspace and everything in it.

## Create your site

After the workspace is successfully created, you'll see a new table name 'Your registered sites'. Same as with the workspaces table, we're going to click the 'Register a new site' button on the top right to create our first.

Clicking the 'Register a new site' button will open the Register/Edit a site modal. Click anywhere on the map and it will create a new map marker and automatically populate the location form fields. Fill out the rest of form and click save.

On the 'Sites' page you'll now see the map zoomed in to your new site, and your site will be added to the registered sites table.

Clicking the newly created table row for your site will direct you to the 'Site Details' page. This page is where you can edit the site's information and access control, delete it, or add new datastreams as you'll see in the next part of this tutorial.
